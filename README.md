Logophi is a simple thesaurus program that utilizes the [Thesaurus.com](http://thesaurus.com) API. It allows the user to quickly search for words and view synonyms and antonyms for their various possible definitions.

The program is currently in the early alpha stage of development and many features are incomplete. There are likely to be a lot of bugs at this time.
